# Population_Growth_Analysis_of_Banished
## **Idea & Motivation**
For this project, I have decided to look into how a settlement building game, Banished, handles population growth. My aim with this project, beyond analyzing a game I've played in an academic setting, is to gain insight on population growth models as a whole, an important problem with many real life applications. Population growth in Banished depends, among other non-negligible factors I have chosen to omit because they are only applicable many in-game years after the start of a new save file, on three major factors: The current population, as more people can give more births provided they aren't limited by other factors; the amount of food stockpiled, where if there isn't a surplus of food available, a famine will cause a sharp decline in population until food production is back in order; and the number of available housing, people in Banished cannot give birth without enough space.
